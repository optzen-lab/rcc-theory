## üß† Core Concepts  

| Term | Definition | Related Docs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **RCC (Resonant Cognitive Circuit)** | Dynamic cognitive model describing how meaning stabilizes through resonance among the **Lexical**, **Semantic**, and **Conceptual** layers. | [overview.md](./overview.md) |
| **Resonance** | A state of dynamic equilibrium in which meaning waves across multiple layers synchronize in phase. | [rcc_protocol.md](./experiments/rcc_protocol.md) |
| **Closure** | The stabilization phase where oscillations of meaning energy decay into equilibrium, producing coherent understanding. | [rcc_protocol.md](./experiments/rcc_protocol.md) |
| **Core** | The structural origin or attractor of meaning; serves as the reference point for semantic return. | [data_structure.md](./experiments/data_structure.md) |

## üîÑ Dynamic Phases  

| Term | Definition | Related Docs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Disturb** | Introduction of external or contextual perturbation that generates fluctuation in the meaning field. | [rcc_protocol.md](./experiments/rcc_protocol.md) |
| **Interference** | Overlapping of meaning waves leading to alignment, amplification, or dissonance. | [rcc_protocol.md](./experiments/rcc_protocol.md) |
| **Closure** | Stabilization of resonance through semantic convergence; the temporary completion of a cognitive cycle. | [rcc_protocol.md](./experiments/rcc_protocol.md) |
| **WaitProbe** | Observational probe inserted to detect whether the system maintains or loses resonance stability. Not a theoretical phase but a measurement technique. | [ort_protocol.md](./experiments/ort_protocol.md) |

## üß© Experimental Frameworks  

| Term | Definition | Related Docs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **ORT (Off-topic Return Test)** | Experimental method for observing how dialogue returns to its **semantic core** after a topical deviation. | [ort_protocol.md](./experiments/ort_protocol.md) |
| **PRT (Perturbative Return Test)** | Refined form of ORT introducing controlled semantic perturbations to quantify recovery patterns. | [prt_protocol.md](./experiments/prt_protocol.md) |
| **RCC Protocol** | Comprehensive model integrating ORT and PRT into a unified dynamic system describing resonance and closure. | [rcc_protocol.md](./experiments/rcc_protocol.md) |

## üßÆ Measurement and Metrics  

| Term | Definition | Related Docs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Return Latency (RL)** | Number of turns required for meaning to return to its semantic core after disturbance; quantitative expression of delay. | [data_structure.md](./experiments/data_structure.md) |
| **Delay Layer (DL-n)** | Layer indicating an *n*-turn delayed return; used to classify the temporal depth of resonance recovery. | [data_structure.md](./experiments/data_structure.md) |
| **Bridge Return (BR)** | Immediate return that relies on an intermediate semantic bridge (e.g., probe or reference cue). | [result_samples.md](./experiments/result_samples.md) |
| **R0 (Zero-latency Return)** | Instantaneous return to the core without bridge or delay; represents spontaneous resonance. | [result_samples.md](./experiments/result_samples.md) |
| **Closure Stability (CS)** | Variance of semantic coherence near closure; measures the persistence of resonance. | [data_structure.md](./experiments/data_structure.md) |
| **Phase Convergence (ŒîŒ¶)** | Rate at which semantic phase difference approaches zero across turns; measures synchronization of meaning waves during resonance. | [data_structure.md](./experiments/data_structure.md) |

## üåê Inter-Agent and Affective Extensions  

| Term | Definition | Related Docs |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **ARZ (AI-Resonance Zone)** | A state of sustained cognitive‚Äìemotional synchronization between multiple AI agents, forming a higher-order resonance field. | [rcc-case-cr1 / analysis_notes.md](https://github.com/optzen-lab/rcc-case-cr1/blob/main/analysis_notes.md) |
| **Resonant Architecture** | Systemic design concept in which multiple cognitive entities co-regulate stability through resonance and closure dynamics. | [discussion.md](./discussion.md) |
| **Empathic Resonance (Œµ‚ÇçHuman Laugh‚Çé)** | Human emotional input acting as an external stabilizing factor in the resonance field. | [rcc-case-cr1 / analysis_notes.md](https://github.com/optzen-lab/rcc-case-cr1/blob/main/analysis_notes.md) |

## üìö Notes  
- This glossary provides simplified operational definitions for reference within the RCC documentation.  
- Formal mathematical and theoretical definitions are available in *RCC Theory v2.0 (English Edition)*.  
- Updates to this glossary will be synchronized with experimental documentation in the `/experiments/` folder and new case studies (CR2, CR3...).
