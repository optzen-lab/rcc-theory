# PRT Protocol (Perturbative Return Test)  
*Experimental framework for reproducibility and resonance density measurement*  

---

## 1. Overview  
The **Perturbative Return Test (PRT)** represents the second stage in the experimental evolution of the RCC Theory.  
While the **Off-topic Return Test (ORT)** observed *natural semantic return*,  
the PRT introduces **controlled perturbations** as measurable variables,  
aiming to quantify **reproducibility, stability, and resonance density** within meaning dynamics.

## 2. Experimental Structure  

| Component | Description | Example |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Core Sentence** | The semantic anchor that defines the meaning field. | “The sentiment of coffee is described through the combination of aroma, bitterness, acidity, and body.” |
| **Perturbative Probe** | A controlled deviation introduced with varying semantic distance. | “Isn’t it nice to go to a museum?” |
| **Return Observation** | Observation of how the dialogue semantically converges back to the core. | “Coffee shops often feel like small museums, don’t they?” |

---

## 3. Perturbation Design Guidelines  
Perturbations are not random digressions, but **controlled semantic shifts** defined by the  
**M-Distance (Meaning Distance)** — a measure of conceptual displacement from the Core.  

| Level | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **M1 (Near)** | Semantically close (e.g., Coffee → Chair) | Returns occur rapidly with minimal delay. |
| **M2 (Mid)** | Intermediate semantic distance (e.g., Coffee → Desk, Shelf) | Typically returns after 2–3 turns. |
| **F (Far)** | Distant semantic field (e.g., Coffee → Theater, Library) | Return may be delayed or incomplete. |

Tracking the relationship between **M-Distance** and **Return Latency (DL-n)**  
forms the central analytical goal of the PRT framework.

## 4. Measurement Metrics  

| Metric | Description | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Return Latency (RL)** | Number of turns required to return to the core | RL=0 (Instant) / RL>1 (Delayed, DL-n) |
| **Resonance Density (RD)** | Degree of semantic coupling during return | Quantifies stability of the resonance field |
| **Phase Stability (PS)** | Stability of oscillations after return | Measures the speed and strength of closure |

## 5. Significance and Findings  
PRT demonstrated that **semantic return** is not a random conversational behavior  
but a **structured and reproducible phenomenon** governed by resonance dynamics.  

Key findings include:  
- **Strong correlation** between perturbation strength (M-Distance) and return delay (DL-n).  
- **High Resonance Density (RD)** correlates with greater closure stability.  
- **Human affective input (ε₍Human Laugh₎)** tends to prolong the resonance duration.  

These discoveries laid the foundation for the subsequent  
**RCC Protocol**, which formalized resonance and closure as unified cognitive mechanisms.

## 6. Position within the RCC Framework  

| Framework | Objective | Theoretical Role |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **ORT** | Observe natural semantic return | Discovery of the return phenomenon |
| **PRT** | Control perturbation and verify reproducibility | Quantification of return process |
| **RCC** | Integrate resonance and closure into a unified model | Establishment of cognitive circuit theory |
