*Core experimental frameworks supporting the development of RCC Theory*

## üß≠ Overview  
This section summarizes the three main experimental frameworks  
that laid the empirical foundation for the **Resonant Cognitive Circuit (RCC) Theory**.  

Each framework explores a distinct stage of the dynamic process of meaning ‚Äî  
**Return**, **Resonance**, and **Closure** ‚Äî revealing how linguistic systems  
stabilize meaning through self-organizing feedback.  

| Stage | Protocol | Objective | Summary |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Stage 1** | [ORT Protocol](./ort_protocol.md) | Observe natural semantic return | First verification of ‚Äúsemantic gravity‚Äù after topical deviation. |
| **Stage 2** | [PRT Protocol](./prt_protocol.md) | Control perturbation to verify reproducibility | Introduces measurable perturbation strength (M-Distance) and delay layers (DL-n). |
| **Stage 3** | [RCC Protocol](./rcc_protocol.md) | Integrate resonance and closure as unified theory | Core model describing interference, resonance, and dynamic closure. |

## üß© Relationship to Theory  
These protocols were designed to experimentally verify  
the **three-layer structure of RCC Theory** ‚Äî  
**Lexical**, **Semantic**, and **Conceptual** ‚Äî  
and to measure how meaning restores equilibrium across these layers.  

Each stage examines a different scale of **Semantic Restorability**,  
collectively forming the empirical basis of the full RCC model.

## üß† Reading Order  
1. Start with **ORT** ‚Äî understanding how meaning naturally returns to its core.  
2. Continue with **PRT** ‚Äî verifying reproducibility through controlled perturbations.  
3. Conclude with **RCC** ‚Äî modeling resonance and closure as dynamic equilibrium.  

This progression provides a clear conceptual pathway  
from observation to formal theory, highlighting how meaning stabilizes  
through **Resonance**, **Return**, and **Closure** mechanisms.
