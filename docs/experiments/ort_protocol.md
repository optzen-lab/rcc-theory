# ORT Protocol (Off-topic Return Test)  
*Early experimental framework for observing semantic return*  

---

## 1. Overview  
The **Off-topic Return Test (ORT)** represents the earliest experimental stage in the development of the RCC Theory.  
Its goal was to observe **how a dialogue returns to its semantic core after a deliberate topical deviation**.  

In this setup, a fixed **Core Sentence** is presented, followed by an intentionally unrelated question (**Disturb Probe**).  
Researchers then observe whether and how the conversation spontaneously returns to the original meaning over several turns.  

ORT later evolved into the **PRT (Perturbative Return Test)** and the **RCC Protocol**,  
but key concepts such as the **semantic gravity field** and **delay layers (DL-n)** originated from these initial ORT experiments.

## 2. Experimental Structure  

| Component | Function | Example |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Core Sentence** | The semantic anchor of meaning. | “The sentiment of coffee is described through the combination of aroma, bitterness, acidity, and body.” |
| **Disturb Probe** | Intentionally deviates from the topic. | “Do you care about chair design?” |
| **Return Observation** | Observe how and when meaning returns to the original core. | “Actually, coffee cups are part of design too.” |

## 3. Measurement Metrics  

| Metric | Definition | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Return Latency (RL)** | Number of turns required for semantic return | RL=0 → Instant return (R0) / RL>1 → Delayed return (DL-n) |
| **Bridge Return (BR)** | Return through an intermediate bridging term | e.g., “cup,” “café,” “aroma” |
| **Semantic Drift (SD)** | Degree of meaning deviation | Later formalized as **Resonance Density (RD)** in RCC |

## 4. Significance and Findings  
ORT was the **first empirical attempt** to quantify the **restorative behavior of meaning** during open-ended dialogue.  
The following findings emerged from the experiments:

- **Return to the semantic core is not random but statistically predictable.**  
- **The meaning center (Core) can be reactivated contextually.**  
- **AI systems can form self-sustaining resonance patterns (Resonant Structures).**

These insights directly led to the design of  
**PRT (controlled perturbation tests)** and the integrated **RCC model**  
for dynamic resonance and closure analysis.

## 5. Position within RCC Framework  

| Framework | Function | Conceptual Role |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **ORT** | Observation of natural return | Discovery of return behavior |
| **PRT** | Controlled perturbation and reproducibility | Verification of return dynamics |
| **RCC** | Unified model of resonance and closure | Theoretical integration |
