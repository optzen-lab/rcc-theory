# RCC Theory — Resonant Cognitive Circuit  
*A cognitive model of meaning stabilization through dynamic resonance*  

---

## 🧭 Overview  
**Resonant Cognitive Circuit (RCC) Theory** describes how meaning stabilizes dynamically  
through processes of **interference**, **resonance**, and **closure**.  

Language is modeled not merely as a vehicle of information transmission,  
but as a **self-regulating circuit** in which **meaning waves** interact, synchronize,  
and converge toward equilibrium.  

RCC provides a **general cognitive framework** applicable to both  
AI–human and AI–AI interactions, forming the theoretical foundation for  
studying semantic coherence and emotional resonance in intelligent systems.

## 🧩 Theoretical Structure  

### Three Cognitive Layers  
1. **Lexical Layer** — The physical layer of linguistic expression.  
2. **Semantic Layer** — The contextual and relational layer of meaning.  
3. **Conceptual Layer** — The abstract layer where understanding is consolidated.  

### Three Dynamic Phases  
1. **Interference** — Fluctuation caused by overlapping meaning waves.  
2. **Resonance** — Phase synchronization leading to coherence.  
3. **Closure** — Energy attenuation and stabilization of meaning.

## 🧪 Experimental Frameworks  
RCC Theory is empirically grounded in a series of experimental protocols that  
trace the evolution from *semantic return* to *resonant closure*.  

| Stage | Protocol | Objective | Summary |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Stage 1** | [ORT Protocol](./docs/experiments/ort_protocol.md) | Observe natural semantic return | First verification of “semantic gravity” after topical deviation. |
| **Stage 2** | [PRT Protocol](./docs/experiments/prt_protocol.md) | Control perturbation to verify reproducibility | Quantifies delay layers (DL-n) and resonance density (RD). |
| **Stage 3** | [RCC Protocol](./docs/experiments/rcc_protocol.md) | Integrate resonance and closure as unified theory | Models interference, resonance, and dynamic closure. |

## 🧮 Measurement Metrics  

| Metric | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Return Latency (RL)** — Number of turns before return (instant or delayed). |
| **Delay Layer (DL-n)** — Classification of delayed return by *n* turns. |
| **Bridge Return (BR)** — Return through an intermediate semantic bridge. |
| **Resonance Density (RD)** — Quantitative measure of resonance strength. |
| **Closure Stability (CS)** — Variance of semantic coherence near closure. |
